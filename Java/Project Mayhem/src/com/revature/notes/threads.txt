Threads
	When you start a program three threads are created
	Main
	Garbage
		Daemon Thread= we don't interact with or control tehses they are low-priority
		Intermitently removes dereferenced objects from memory
		Cannot forceCollections but can request for it to run
	System.gc() // asks for the garbage collector to help
		We can intervene with the process of garbage collection
			Override java.lang.Object.finalize();
			to specify behavior at the time of garbage collection
		Difference between final, finalize() and finally?
