Object oriented programming
	Inheritance
		When a programming language allows for a hierarchy of objects
		Child objects obtain states and behaviors from parents objects.
		Classes can only inherit from one single class. **Diamond problem**
	Encapsulation
		When you wrap and protect related data from outside manipulation
		usually requires Getters(accessors) Setters(Manipulators) 
	Polymorphism
		The ability for a programming language to be able to tell the diff between objects of the same type.
		Overriding - Same name, same parameters, diff behavior. @Override a commonly named method to return something diff of the same type
		Overloading - Same name, diff parameters. 
			Parametric Polymorphism - The ability for the complier to determine which method to call based on the inputs given
		Multiple "is-a" relationships Object>Animal>Cat
			Covariance - every cat is an animal
			Contravariance - every animal is not a cat
	Abstraction 
		Often omitted as one of the pillars of OOP
		Hiding the implementation details.  "What is does, not how it does it"
		Abstract class - have no implementation
