	Primative types - a value; 8 total
		char
		boolean
		byte
		short
		int
		long
		float
		double
	Reference types - an object; more than just a value
		arrays

Numeric type conversions
	Narrowing - Going from larger memory allocation to a smaller, may result in loss of percision
	Widening - 	going from smaller to larger
Casting
	Manually changing the data type; ex. a=(int)b 
Java is a passes by value language.
	it passes the value of the reference rather than the reference themselves
